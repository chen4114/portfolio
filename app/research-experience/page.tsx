          Machine learning for device optimization (collaborated with Microsoft, QuEra, and Oak Ridge National Lab)
          We present using machine learning/quantum computing for characterization, fabrication, and inverse design of device applications, such as adjoint simulation, generative model-assisted design, hybrid quantum-classical optimization, LLM model-embedded multimodal training.

          The global chip industry is grappling with dual challenges: a profound shortage of new chips and a surge of counterfeit chips valued at $75 billion, introducing substantial risks of malfunction and unwanted surveillance. To counteract this, we propose optical anti-counterfeiting methods for semiconductor devices that is robust under adversarial tampering features.

          • Extracted features of gold nanoparticles from 1000 dark-field images in just 27 ms and verified their authenticity using RAPTOR in 80 ms with 97.6% accuracy under difficult adversarial tampering conditions.
